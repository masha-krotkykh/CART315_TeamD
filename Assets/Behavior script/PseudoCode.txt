PseudoCode:All variables should be controllable by the people running the behavior (they should be inputted into the function) Radius, Target, Desired ActionThe script should spawn an empty that has a large collider to act as a controllable behavior radius, parented to the object running the script.The script queries all objects within the collider, searching for specific names/objects (as inputed by what object the scriptcaller should target)The closest object should be determined and the navmesh script should be called towards it, inputting its location.Once it has arrived, it should smoothly call the desired action script, and any further behavior desired.
